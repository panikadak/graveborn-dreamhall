## A Prison for Dreams

*A Prison for Dreams* is maybe not-so-surprisingly a yet another 2D metroidvania thing, in the style of my previous games, except bigger and better than ever before!

### [Play here](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/a-prison-for-dreams)



-----


## Building

The following tools are required:
- **TypeScript compiler**
- **Git LFS** (to get access to the asset files)
- **Closure compiler** (optional)

To build the game, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jani-nykanen/a-prison-for-dreams
```
and run 
```
tsc
```
(or `make js` if you have `make` installed). It will compile the TypeScript source to Javascript, and you can run the game by starting a server in the root (for example run `make server` and open `localhost:8000` in your browser).

If you want to compile a redistributable and compressed zip package, run 
```
make CLOSURE_PATH=<path to closure jar file> dist 
```
(there is a bug that requires you to run `tsc` first, otherwise the thing will faill).

If you want to make a lot of changes to the source, it is recommended to compile the source in watch mode (`tsc -w` or `make watch`).


-----


## Building a desktop version

Run `make CLOSURE_PATH=<path to closure jar file> nwpackage`. It will create a file called `package.nw`. Then download [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/), unpack it and put `package.nw` to the root.
